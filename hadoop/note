Core conception
-HDFS

-Block
    File in HDFS is stored by block, default block size is 64MB, block is storage logic unit.

-NameNode
	Is admin node, store file unit data
		1). File and data block mapping
		2). Data block and data node mapping

-DataNode
	Is working node, store data block


Data management strategy
  1). Every block has three copies
  2). DataNode send heartbeat to NameNode periodly
  3). Secondary NameNode, dync unit data image file and edit log periodly, when NameNode fails, secondary become main NameNode.


File Read/Write
	Read: search and responde client with DataNode
	Write:
		1). File splite to block
		2). Return available DataNodes by NameNode
		3). Write to Blocks in DataNode
		4). Pipeline copys
		5). Update unit data to NameNode


MapReduce
	Task split to multiple sub-tasks(map-tasks).
	Input split->Shuffle->Output

	-Job & Task

	-JobTacker, main node, job schedule, allocate task, monitor.
	-TaskTracker, execute task, report task status.

-YARN
	ResourceManager
		1). Allocate and schedule resources
		2). Start and monitor ApplicationMaster
		3). Monitor NodeManager
	NodeManager
		1). Manage single node resource
		2). Handle command from ResourceManager
		3). Handle command from ApplicationMaster



Commands
get, put, copyFromLocal, copyToLocal
